# My Jekyll Boilerplate

This is a _simple_ boilerplate setup for Jekyll websites. It saves me setting up the same (folder-) structure every time I need a Jekyll website.

It also adds jQuery, HTML5 Shiv and Normalize CSS (v3.0.0) and adds a Sass folder (TODO: add boilerplate `scss` code from e.g. inuitcss or davidhund -> `dh-kickstart-style`). Some of the files (`.htaccess`, `robots.txt`, favicons, etc) are taken straight from the [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://h5bp.com).

That's allâ€¦
